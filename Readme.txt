2D Diffusion Problem
Objectives: 
 To simulate diffusion phenomena in an undersaturated porous media
 Specifically, the following codes will be written. 
 
 Multi-resolution Gridding 
 Random walk on numerical porous media made of 1D and 2D diffusion media 
 Multi-grid FD or FE for 2D linear diffusion problems
